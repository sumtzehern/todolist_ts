## Inspiration
The need for an efficient and user-friendly to-do list application inspired the creation of this project. I recognized the importance of having a tool that allows users to seamlessly create, edit, prioritize, and manage their tasks. Drawing inspiration from the everyday challenges of task management, I aimed to develop a solution that simplifies the process and enhances productivity.

## What it does
The Todo Web Application provides users with a comprehensive platform to create, edit, and manage their to-do lists effectively. I can add tasks, update their details, prioritize them, and mark them as done upon completion. The application supports drag-and-drop functionality, enabling users to intuitively organize their tasks. Additionally, I can delete tasks I no longer need, ensuring a clutter-free and streamlined experience.

## Technologies Used
-TypeScript
-React
-HTML
-CSS

## Features
- **Task Creation:** I can create new tasks by providing task names and additional details.
- **Task Editing:** I can edit task details, ensuring the information remains up-to-date.
- **Task Prioritization:** Tasks can be prioritized based on urgency or importance.
- **Drag and Drop:** Intuitive drag-and-drop functionality allows me to rearrange tasks effortlessly.
- **Task Completion:** I can mark tasks as done upon completion, providing a sense of accomplishment.
- **Task Deletion:** Unwanted tasks can be deleted, decluttering the task list.
- **Learning Focus:** The application encourages me to learn TypeScript and React, fostering a deeper understanding of technologies like useRef for efficient task management.

## How I built it
I utilized TypeScript for strong typing, ensuring code integrity and error prevention. React was employed to create a dynamic and responsive user interface, enabling seamless task management. HTML and CSS were used for structuring and styling the application, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing design. The application's features were implemented using React components and state management techniques.

## Challenges I encountered
- **TypeScript Implementation:** Integrating TypeScript posed challenges, especially when handling state and props in React components. Ensuring proper type annotations and interfaces were crucial to prevent type-related errors.
- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality:** Implementing smooth drag-and-drop functionality required a deep understanding of React's state management and event handling. Overcoming hurdles related to re-rendering components and updating task positions was a significant challenge.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I take pride in developing a user-friendly and efficient to-do list application that addresses real-life task management challenges. Overcoming hurdles related to TypeScript implementation and drag-and-drop functionality showcases my dedication to delivering a seamless user experience. My application empowers users to manage their tasks effectively, promoting productivity and organization.

## What I learned
Through this project, I gained valuable insights into TypeScript and React development. Understanding the nuances of TypeScript's static typing and React's component-based architecture deepened my knowledge of modern web development. Additionally, I honed my skills in implementing complex features like drag-and-drop functionality, enhancing my problem-solving abilities and technical expertise.












# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
